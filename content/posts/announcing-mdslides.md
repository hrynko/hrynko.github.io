The process of creating presentations hasn't changed much over the past few decades. It can still be a time-consuming and tedious task, often involving moving text blocks back and forth instead of creating the content itself.

In [MdSlides](https://mdslides.github.io/), that approach is revised to a more declarative way. It's based on Markdown and requires no additional interaction other than writing down one's thoughts. Creating presentations using plain text and formatting them with Markdown also provides accessibility and mobile support, which are common problems of traditional editors. And while it's unlikely to replace traditional editors for all occasions, it can be a good option for individuals who want to share their ideas without the hassle of formatting and layout.
